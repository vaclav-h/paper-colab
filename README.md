# Visualization of collaboration on scientific papers

Implementation of visualization of a collaboration network taken from <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata>. The layout algorithm is implemented in ``fr.py``.  It is a modified version of the Fruchterman and Reingold algorithm [1]. While the visualization is only for the network in ``netscience.gml``, the layout algorithm is applicable to any graph encoded in an adjacency matrix.

The visualization can be run by ``python3 main.py``.
